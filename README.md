# Spotify Streaming Project
This project analyzes my 1-year music streaming data from Spotify. It includes below steps
- Requesting personal streaming data from <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/" target="_blank">Spotify Account Page</a>
- Getting other related data from <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank">Spotify API</a> (Credits to <a href="https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/30-Days-of-Python" target="_blank">30-Days-of-Python by codingforentrepreneurs</a>)
- Using Python to clean up data and generate new files
- Using SQL in Google BigQuery to query meaningful insights
- Create interactive visualization on Tableau, which can be seen at a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/SpotifyProject_16569466169620/MySpotify?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Spotify Project</a>
